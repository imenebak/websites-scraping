# websites-scraping
I made these codes for fun and to help a student to follow her studies in France.
the web scrapers will help you in the different phases of your study project if you also wish to continue your studies in France.
the directory contains 3 main codes:
- a scarper that checks the availability of vfs visa appointments
- a scraper that checks the availability of student accommodation on the CROUS site
- a final scraper that checks the availability of Air Alg√©rie plane tickets
